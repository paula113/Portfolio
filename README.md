I am a passionated Front-End Developer. I make fun, creative, open, and fast websites. I attempt to leave all of code I contact increasingly lucid, measured, performant and more accessible than I discovered it.

Working in a team, I help to set a more clear feeling of direction with an effective and efficient communication proficiency. I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements.
